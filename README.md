# Neural Networks explorer

## Overview
I wanted to learn more Neural Networks, so I started exploring the solutions on github.
I found a basic implementation from Leonard Rabes (https://github.com/LeonardRabes/HandwritingRecognition) 
that seemed easy enough to understand for me.
I didn't want to use a prebuild complex library, but understand the very basics, especially the
backpropagation algorithm.

While playing around with Leonards solution, I decided to improve his work and build a new WPF frontend for it.


## About Neural Networks explorer

![Linktext](./screenshot.png)

The app contains 4 sections:
- section 1 contains the set of training images. 
I also chose (as Leonard) the MNIST data set (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database), 
containing 60.000 classified images
You can go through the images with the slider.


## How to use
- Build and start the program.
- Click "Load training data" (the app expects two files in the bin folder)
-
